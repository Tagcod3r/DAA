## How to Set Up and Run

### Setting Up in Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Create a new Java Project:
   - File > New > Java Project
3. Add the `.java` files to the `src` folder of your project.
4. Ensure the JDK is properly configured in the Eclipse build path.

### Running the Programs
1. **`BinarySearchTree.java`**  
   Demonstrates insertion, deletion, and traversal operations in a Binary Search Tree.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `BinarySearchTree.java`.
   - Follow the program prompts for inputs (if required).

2. **`KnapSackDP.java`**  
   Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `KnapSackDP.java`.
   - Input the weights, values, and knapsack capacity as prompted.

3. **`MergeSort.java`**  
   Implements the Merge Sort algorithm for array sorting.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `MergeSort.java`.
   - Provide the array to sort as input.

4. **`NQueen.java`**  
   Solves the N-Queens problem to place `N` queens on an `NÃ—N` chessboard.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `NQueen.java`.
   - Input the value of `N` when prompted.

5. **`QuickSort.java`**  
   Implements the Quick Sort algorithm for array sorting.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `QuickSort.java`.
   - Provide the array to sort as input.

6. **`SubsetSumK.java`**  
   Finds all subsets of a set that sum to a given value `K` using Dynamic Programming.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `SubsetSumK.java`.
   - Input the set of numbers and the target sum `K` when prompted.

7. **`horspool.java`**  
   Implements Horspool's algorithm for string pattern matching.  
   **Run**:  
   - Execute the `main()` method in `horspool.java`.
   - Input the text and pattern strings as prompted.
